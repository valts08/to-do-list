# Foundation for "to-do list":
# Have at least one list available to any one user ( >= 1 )
# The lists data needs to be saved in a .txt file
# There should be a folder for each user and an N amount of files(lists) that a user has made
# The lists can be read and edited
    # If the list file is empty, it will be deleted
# Format the list (it can't be just a single continous line of text, it needs to be structured)
